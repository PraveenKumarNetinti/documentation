## Styling & Themes

---

### Theme System

**Purpose**: Support light, dark, and high-contrast visual themes for different environments and preferences.

**User Value**: Accountants often work long hours staring at dense tables — dark mode reduces eye strain. High-contrast mode serves users with visual impairments.

**Considerations**:

- Three themes: Light (default), Dark, High Contrast
- Theme toggle in global toolbar (sun/moon icon)
- Respect system preference (prefers-color-scheme) on first load
- Transition animation between themes (150ms cross-fade to prevent jarring flash)
- High-contrast theme meets WCAG AAA (7:1 contrast ratio for text, 3:1 for UI components)

### Row Density

Purpose: Adjust row height and padding to show more or fewer rows in the viewport.

**User Value**: Compact mode maximizes visible data (critical for large monitors); comfortable mode improves readability on smaller screens.

**Considerations**:

- Three density levels: Compact (24px rows), Default (32px), Comfortable (48px)
- Toggle in toolbar (density icon: ☰ with line spacing visual)
- Font size adjusts proportionally (12px / 13px / 14px)
- Density change triggers virtualizer re-measurement
- Cell padding scales: 2px 6px / 4px 8px / 8px

### Per-Column Formatting

**Purpose**: Customize how data is displayed in each column (number format, alignment, etc.).

**User Value**: Accountants need precise control over decimal places, thousands separators, negative number format (parentheses vs. minus sign), and date formats.

**Considerations**:

- Right-click column header → "Format column..."
- Options by data type:
  - **Numbers**: decimal places (0-6), thousands separator, negative format (-100 vs. (100)), percentage mode
  - **Currency**: symbol position, currency code display (\$1,234 vs. 1,234 USD vs. USD 1,234)
  - **Dates**: format pattern (MM/DD/YYYY, DD-MMM-YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, etc.)
- Alignment: left / center / right (numbers default right-aligned)
- Conditional formatting (see 6.4)
- Format preview shown in dialog before applying

### Conditional Formatting

**Purpose**: Apply visual styling rules based on cell values (colors, icons, data bars).

**User Value**: Instantly identify negative balances (red), large variances (bold), or overdue items (highlighted) without reading every number.

**Considerations**:

- Rules engine in Column Settings:
  - Color scale (gradient from green to red based on value range)
  - Threshold rules: "If value \< 0, text color = red"
  - Icon sets: ▲▼ arrows for positive/negative, ● dots for status categories
  - Data bars: horizontal bar within cell proportional to value (like Excel)
- Up to 5 rules per column
- Rules evaluated top-to-bottom, first match wins (or "apply all" mode)
- Preview before applying

### Zebra Striping & Grid Lines

**Purpose**: Visual options for row differentiation and cell boundary clarity.

**User Value**: Dense numeric tables need visual guides to track across columns — zebra striping and grid lines prevent misreading rows.

**Considerations**:

- Toggle: Zebra stripes on/off (alternating row backgrounds)
- Toggle: Vertical grid lines on/off (horizontal always on for readability)
- Column highlight on hover (entire column gets subtle background — helps track column values)
- "Crosshair" mode: highlight both the row and column of the hovered cell

## Table Navigation & Row Actions

---

### "Go to Row" Jump Control

**Purpose**: Instantly navigate to a specific row by number or primary key (e.g., Transaction ID, Journal Entry #).

**User Value**: Accountants frequently reference specific line items during audits or reconciliation. Scrolling through 500K+ rows is infeasible.

**Considerations**:

- Input field in TableToolbar with typeahead supporting both row index and business key lookup
- Show row context preview (surrounding 2–3 rows) before jumping so users confirm they're targeting the right record
- Support range input (e.g., "1500-1520") to jump and auto-select a range
- Animate scroll to destination (brief 150ms ease) so users perceive spatial movement, but offer "instant jump" in preferences for power users
- Maintain focus on the target row after jump for keyboard continuity

### Quick Row Search (Find-in-Table)

**Purpose**: Ctrl+F-style search across all visible columns to locate rows matching a text query.

**User Value**: Analysts searching for a vendor name, memo text, or specific dollar amount across the entire table without knowing which column contains the data.

**Considerations**:

- Floating search bar (like browser find) with match count ("3 of 147 matches"), prev/next navigation
- Highlight matching cells with background color (yellow) and scroll to first match
- Option to "filter to matches only" (narrows the table) vs. "highlight only" (keeps all rows visible)
- Search should work across formatted display values (e.g., "\$1,234.56" matches "1234")
- Escape dismisses, but last search term persists in session

### Minimap / Scroll Position Indicator

**Purpose**: Visual overview of position within the dataset, similar to code editor minimaps.

**User Value**: In 100K+ row tables, the scrollbar thumb becomes tiny and imprecise. A minimap provides spatial context showing where bookmarks, highlighted rows, and search matches exist relative to current viewport.

**Considerations**:

- Narrow vertical strip (12px wide) alongside the scrollbar
- Color-coded markers: bookmarks (blue dots), search matches (yellow), grouped section boundaries (gray lines), current selection (green)
- Click on minimap to jump to that position
- Can be hidden for minimal UI preference

## Column Customization

---

### Column Visibility Management

**Purpose**: Show/hide columns to reduce visual noise and focus on relevant data.

**User Value**: Financial tables often have 40+ columns (debit, credit, running balance, multiple tax fields, department codes, etc.). Users need different column subsets for different tasks (reconciliation vs. reporting vs. audit).

**Considerations**:

- Checklist in a Column Settings side panel with drag-to-reorder
- "Select All / None" and quick filter to find column names
- Show column data type icon (Σ numeric, Aa text) for quick identification
- Minimum 1 column must remain visible (prevent empty table state)
- Column count indicator in toolbar: "Showing 12 of 38 columns"
- Right-click column header → "Hide this column" for quick individual hiding

### Column Reordering

**Purpose**: Arrange columns in the order that matches the user's workflow.

**User Value**: Default column order rarely matches individual workflow. An AP clerk wants vendor name first; an auditor wants GL code first.

**Considerations**:

- Drag-and-drop in column headers (with clear drag handle affordance)
- Also reorderable in Column Settings side panel list (for non-mouse users)
- Keyboard reorder: Ctrl+Shift+Arrow in column header focus
- Visual drop indicator (blue line between columns during drag)
- Pinned columns maintain their pin zone during reorder (can't drag a pinned-left column to the scrollable zone without unpinning)

### Column Pinning (Freeze Columns)

**Purpose**: Keep critical columns visible while horizontally scrolling through the remaining data.

**User Value**: Account number and name should always be visible while scrolling to view period columns or memo fields.

**Considerations**:

- Support left-pin and right-pin (right-pin useful for totals/status columns)
- Visual separator line (shadow/border) between pinned and scrollable zones
- Maximum pin limit (e.g., 6 columns per side) to prevent over-pinning
- Right-click header → "Pin to left / Pin to right / Unpin"
- Pin icon indicator in header

### Column Grouping (Header Groups)

**Purpose**: Visually organize related columns under a parent header.

**User Value**: Financial tables often have Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 columns, or Debit/Credit sub-columns under each department — hierarchical headers make this scannable.

**Considerations**:

- Multi-level header rows (up to 3 levels deep)
- Collapsible column groups (click group header to toggle showing/hiding child columns)
- Visual nesting with alternating header background shades
- Group collapse state persisted in view preferences

## Column Sizing & Scrolling

---

### Column Resizing

**Purpose**: Manually adjust column widths by dragging header borders.

**User Value**: Auto-sized columns can't anticipate every user's needs — some want a wider "Description" column, others want it narrow because they never read it.

**Considerations**:

- Resize handle on right edge of each column header (visible on hover, 6px grab zone)
- Double-click resize handle = auto-fit to content (scans visible rows)
- Minimum width: 40px (prevents accidental collapse to 0)
- Maximum width: 800px (prevents runaway expansion)
- Resize cursor (col-resize) as affordance
- Show width tooltip during drag ("240px")
- "Reset all widths" option in Column Settings

### Auto-Fit Modes

**Purpose**: Automatically size columns to content or distribute available width.

**User Value**: Quick way to optimize table layout without manual resizing each column.

**Considerations**:

- Three modes available from Column Settings:
  - Fit to Content: Each column sized to longest visible value (+ header text)
  - Fit to Page: Columns stretch proportionally to fill viewport width (no horizontal scroll)
  - Fixed: All columns use a uniform width (user-specified)
- Per-column override: any column can be manually resized after auto-fit
- "Fit to Content" should sample visible rows + first/last 100 rows (not full dataset — too slow for 1M rows)

### Virtualized Rendering

**Purpose**: Render only visible rows and columns to maintain 60fps performance with massive datasets.

**User Value**: Transparent to users — they simply experience a fast, responsive table regardless of data size.

**Considerations**:

- Scrollbar should accurately represent total dataset size (not just rendered rows)
- No visible pop-in or flickering during fast scrolling
- "Overscan" buffer (render 20 extra rows above/below viewport) to prevent blank flashes
- Consider showing a loading shimmer for extremely fast scroll (scroll velocity \> threshold)
- Row height: fixed preferred for performance; if variable, pre-measure or estimate

### Horizontal Scroll via Keyboard & Shift+Scroll

**Purpose**: Allow horizontal navigation without a horizontal scrollbar click.

**User Value**: Accountants on laptops without mice need efficient horizontal traversal. Horizontal scrollbar is often tiny and hard to target.

**Considerations**:

- Shift+MouseWheel = horizontal scroll (standard UX convention)
- Arrow keys when focused on a cell navigate cell-by-cell (including horizontally)
- Tab/Shift+Tab moves through focusable cells in reading order
- When a cell is focused via keyboard, auto-scroll to bring it into view (both axes)

Optional: bottom horizontal scrollbar made thicker (12px) for easier targeting

## Sorting & Filtering

---

### Multi-Column Sorting

**Purpose**: Sort data by multiple columns in priority order.

**User Value**: "Sort by Account Type ascending, then by Date descending, then by Amount descending" — essential for financial data analysis.

**Considerations**:

- Click column header = single-column sort (toggles asc → desc → none)
- Shift+Click = add column to multi-sort stack
- Sort priority numbers displayed in header (①, ②, ③)
- Sort indicator arrows (▲▼) in headers
- "Clear all sorts" button in toolbar when any sort is active
- Sort configuration also available in dedicated sort panel (for keyboard users and complex sorts)
- Stable sort guarantee: rows with equal values maintain their original relative order

### Column-Specific Filtering

**Purpose**: Filter rows based on column values with type-appropriate filter controls.

**User Value**: "Show me only Expense accounts with amounts \> \$10,000 in Q3 2024" — complex filtering is daily work for analysts.

**Considerations**:

- Filter icon in each column header; clicking opens a filter popover anchored to that column
- Filter type adapts to column data type:
  - **Text**: contains / equals / starts with / regex + quick-select checklist of unique values
  - **Numeric/Currency**: equals / greater than / less than / between / top N / bottom N
  - **Date**: exact date / date range picker / relative (last 30 days, this quarter, YTD)
  - **Enum/Category**: multi-select checklist with search
- Active filters shown as dismissible chips in toolbar: [Account Type: Expense ×] [Amount: \> \$10K ×]
- Compound filters: AND within same column, AND/OR between columns (advanced mode)
- Filter count badge on column header when active

### Saved Filter Presets

**Purpose**: Save and recall named filter configurations.

**User Value**: Accountants run the same analyses repeatedly (month-end review, audit prep, reconciliation). Rebuilding complex filters each time is wasteful.

**Considerations**:

- "Save current filters as..." option → name input dialog
- Dropdown of saved presets in filter area
- Edit/rename/delete saved presets
- Share presets with team members (if collaboration features exist)
- System presets for common accounting scenarios (e.g., "Unreconciled Items," "High-Value Transactions")

### Quick Column Filters (Inline Header Filters)

**Purpose**: Persistent filter row directly below the header for rapid, always-visible filtering.

**User Value**: Power users (most accountants) prefer an always-visible filter row rather than opening popovers — similar to Excel's filter row.

**Considerations**:

- Optional secondary header row with compact filter inputs per column
- Toggled on/off via toolbar button ("Show filter row")
- Text columns: simple text input with implicit "contains"
- Numeric: comparison operator dropdown + number input
- Date: compact date range picker
- Must not interfere with column resize or sort click targets

## Grouping & Summaries

---

### Row Grouping

**Purpose**: Group rows by one or more column values, creating a hierarchical tree structure.

**User Value**: "Group all transactions by Account Type, then by Department" — fundamental for financial review and reporting.

**Considerations**:

- Drag column header to a "group zone" drop area above the table
- Or right-click header → "Group by this column"
- Multi-level grouping (up to 4 levels to prevent performance degradation)
- Group rows show: group value, row count, and aggregate values
- Expand/collapse individual groups; "Expand All / Collapse All" buttons
- Indentation for nested groups (16px per level)
- Group row visually distinct (bold text, subtle background, expand/collapse chevron)
- When grouped, original row numbers shown alongside group-relative indices

### Aggregate / Summary Rows

**Purpose**: Display computed aggregates (sum, average, count, min, max) at group level and table footer.

**User Value**: "What's the total debits for the Expense group?" — eliminates the need to export to Excel for basic summarization.

**Considerations**:

- Per-column aggregate function selector (right-click column header → "Summarize: Sum / Avg / Count / Min / Max / None")
- Aggregates shown in:
  - Group rows (when grouping is active)
  - Sticky footer row (always, for full table)
  - Status bar for selected rows (selection-scoped aggregates)
- Formatted with same column formatting (currency, decimals, etc.)
- Weighted average option for financial calculations
- Aggregate values visually distinguished (bold, slightly different background)

### Subtotal Rows (Inline Subtotals)

**Purpose**: Insert subtotal rows at natural breakpoints (e.g., after each account category) without full grouping.

**User Value**: Mimics traditional accounting report formats (trial balance, income statement) where subtotals appear inline.

**Considerations**:

- "Insert subtotals by [column]" option adds subtotal rows after each distinct value change in a sorted column
- Subtotal row spans the full width, shows aggregates for numeric columns
- Visually styled as a separator row (heavier border, bold text, light background)
- Can be enabled alongside sorting (sort by the subtotal column first, then enable subtotals)


## Export & Copy

---

### Export Visible Data

**Purpose**: Export the current view (after filtering, sorting, grouping) to CSV, Excel (XLSX), or PDF.

**User Value**: Accountants need to extract data for reports, share with colleagues, or import into other systems.

**Considerations**:

- Export button in toolbar with format dropdown (CSV, XLSX, PDF)
- Export scope options:
  - "All rows (current view)" — all filtered/sorted rows
  - "Selected rows only"
  - "Current page" (if paginated)
  - "All data (unfiltered)" — with warning about size
- Include/exclude options:
  - Group headers and subtotals (when grouped)
  - Column formatting (XLSX can preserve number formats)
  - Hidden columns
- Progress indicator for large exports (>50K rows)
- File name auto-generated: {table-name}_{date}_{filter-summary}.csv


### Copy-Paste Friendly

**Purpose**: Copy selected cells/rows to clipboard in tab-separated format compatible with Excel paste.

**User Value**: Quick copy of a few rows to paste into an email, spreadsheet, or another tool.

**Considerations**:

- Select cells/rows → Ctrl+C copies as TSV (tab-separated values)
- Include column headers as first row of copied data
- Copy formatting: plain text for paste into text editors, rich text for paste into Excel
- Right-click context menu: "Copy selected rows," "Copy column," "Copy cell value"
- Visual flash/toast on copy: "42 rows copied to clipboard"
- Support for Ctrl+A to select all visible rows


### Print-Friendly View

**Purpose**: Generate a print-optimized layout of the current table view.

**User Value**: Physical printouts still common in accounting for signing, filing, and meeting review.

**Considerations**:

- "Print" option opens a print preview in a new window/modal
- Print layout:
  - Repeating column headers on each page
  - Page numbers and table title in header/footer
  - Adjusted column widths to fit page width (or landscape option)
  - Subtotals and group headers preserved
  - Conditional formatting colors adjusted for grayscale printing option
- Page break controls: break after each group, or every N rows
- Option to include/exclude filter summary at top of printout


## Advanced Features for Massive Datasets

---

### View Management (Saved Views)

**Purpose**: Save complete table configurations (columns, sort, filter, grouping, formatting) as named views.

**User Value**: An accountant needs different views for different tasks: "Month-End Close," "Audit Review," "AP Aging Analysis." Reconfiguring the table each time wastes 5-10 minutes.

**Considerations**:

- "Views" dropdown in toolbar showing saved views + "Save current as..."
- Auto-save option: changes to current view save automatically (with undo)
- Default view: system-provided baseline that can't be deleted
- View includes ALL state: column visibility, order, widths, pinning, sort, filters, grouping, formatting, density, column formats
- "Share view" generates a shareable link or saves view for the team
